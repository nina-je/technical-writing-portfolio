# Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository showcases a selection of technical writing samples, including API documentation, user guides, and reference content.

All samples are written in Markdown and follow a docs-as-code workflow (Git, pull requests), emphasizing clarity, structure, and usability for technical audiences.

## Contents

- `docs/api/` – sample API documentation for bet-related endpoints  
- `docs/reference/` – entity reference materials, including bet lifecycle, attributes, and relationships  
- `docs/guides/` – user-oriented guides and how-tos (if applicable)

## Notes

- All samples are illustrative and not tied to a live production system.
- This portfolio demonstrates skills in technical writing, organizing information, creating clear examples, and documenting API endpoints and system data.

## How to Use

- Browse `docs/api/` for endpoint guides with request/response examples, query parameters, and common scenarios.  
- Check `docs/reference/` for entity details, data models, and relationships.  
- Guides in `docs/guides/` illustrate user-focused instructions or workflow explanations.
